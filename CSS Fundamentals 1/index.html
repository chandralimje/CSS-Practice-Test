Also, all the colleges and schools become closed due to high temperature during the summer months (Half may and complete June and sometimes first one or two weeks of July). Also, the kids relax and enjoy this time of the years as they do not have to go to school or colleges. Most of the children either go to a cool place like a hill station or visit their native village to have fun with cousins, and friends.

Also, what people do is they build a human pyramid to break the matki. Since the matki is too high they have to build a tall pyramid. As a result, many people have to take part in sport. Moreover, there are other teams too who stop them from breaking the matki. Equal chances are there for both the teams. Each team gets a chance for a particular time period. If the team is not able to do it in time then the other team tries it. This is an interesting sport many people gather to watch this sport.</p>
